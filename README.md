# Indian-Election-Analysis

## Objective
This project aims to identify the factors which play a substantial role in deciding the winning candiature in the Indian elections. Using Linear Regression, we calcuate a "score" and assign it to each candidate contesting the election. The score is a correlation of the candidate's chances of winning or losing.

We further calcuate feature importance using Random Forest Algorithm to determine which features significantly dominate in curating this model's result.

## Some Background about the Indian Election Ecosystem:

India holds the general elections for the lower house of the parliament after every five years. Elections are held over 543 seats (total number of elected candidates) across 29 states and 7 Union Territories. With over 900 million elligible voters and more than 7000 candidates in 2019, the general elections in India are the largest in the world.

#### The data for the 2019 elections has not yet been published by the Election Commission of India. For this project, the available data from 2004, 2009 and 2014 elections is used.
